App Framework
=============
The App Framework is the basic skeleton app that I use for most simple PHP projects. It works the way I want and definetly built around my preferences and how I code.

The framework is built using the folowing components:
* PHP 5.4.24
* Smarty 
* Sqlite 3.1.18
* Bootstrap 3.1.1

There are a number of classes and helpers that make setting up a quick one-off application easy:
* App
* DB
* Validate
* Smarty Plugins
* Utility Functions
